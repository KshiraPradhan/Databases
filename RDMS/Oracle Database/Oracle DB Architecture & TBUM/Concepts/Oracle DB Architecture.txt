Intro
=====
-Oracle DB is an RDBMS[Relational Database Management System]
-its all about the understanding the logical and physical structure, here the Logical and physical structures are separate.
-The advantage,This separations brings, is that the physical storage structures can be changed without affecting the logical struture.

Logical structure
=================
-The logical structure of the Oracle DB consists of
1)TableSpace
2)Schema
Physical Strutures
==================
The physical layer of the DB consists of three types of files
1)Data files
2)Redo log files
3)Control files

Sytem Global Area[SGA]
======================
-The SGA is a shared-memory region that oracle uses to store data and control informations for an Oracle instance
-It is allocated when the oracle instance starts and it is de-allocated when the oracle instance shuts down.
-Each Oracle instance that starts has its own SGA
-The informations stored in SGA is divided into three memory structures
1)DataBase Buffers cache
2)Redo log buffers
3)Shared pool

Program Global Area[PGA]
========================
-PGA is a memory buffer that contains data and control informations of server process.
-A Server process is a process that services a clients request. 
-A PGA is created by oracle when a server process is started.
-The informations in a PGA depends on the oracle configurations. The PGA area is a non-shared area of memory created by Oracle when a server process is started
-The basic difference between SGA and PGA is that PGA cannot be shared between multiple processes, in the sense, that is used only for requirements of a particular process whereas the SGA is used for the whole instance and it is shared.

Background Process
==================
-The relationships between the DB physical and Memory strutures are maintained and enforced by background processes.
-Number of background processes varies depending upon the DB configurations
-The trace files are only created when there is an problem
-The following are a few of the many available background processes in oracle
a)SMON-System Monitor
b)PMON-Process Monitor
c)DBWR-Database Writer
d)LGWR-Log Writer
e)ARCH-Archiever
