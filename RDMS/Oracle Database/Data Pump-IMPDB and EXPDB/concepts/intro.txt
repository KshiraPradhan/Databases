Intro Data Pup-IMPDB and EXPDB
==============================
-It is a new features of Oracle DB 10g that provides high speed, parallel, bulk data and metadata movement of Oracle DB contents
-this is a new technology enables transferring data from one DB to another using the following utilities.
1)Data Pump Export[Invoked using EXPDP]
2)Data Pump Import[Invoked using IMPDP]

-This utilities are similar in terms of look and feel with the pre oracle 10g IMPort and EXPort utitlites, however technically these are completely different
-*Dump files generated by the ogrinal export utility [EXP] cannot be imported using the new Data Pump Import utility [IMPDP] and vice-versa
-*Data Pump Export[EXPDP] and data Pump Import[IMPDP] are server based rather than client-based as in the case with the orginal Export[EXP] and Import [IMP].
-Data Pump Export and Import tools have vastly improved performance and greatly enhanced functionality such as flexible object selection and better monitoring and control of export and import jobs.
-Oracle recommends using these new Data Pump Export and import clients rather then orginal export[EXP] and Import [IMP] clients
-these are server side utilities,Dump,Log and SQL files are accessed relative to the server-based directory paths.
